c Functions

This project explores the use of variadic functions in C, which allow a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments. The project implements several utility functions using stdarg.h, including operations for summing parameters, printing numbers, printing strings, and printing different data types.

Learning Objectives

Understand how variadic functions work in C

Use va_list, va_start, va_arg, and va_end

Implement functions that handle dynamic numbers of arguments

Apply formatting and printing techniques
