# Doubly Linked Lists

This project introduces **doubly linked lists**, a fundamental data structure in low-level programming.  
Unlike singly linked lists, each node contains two pointers:

- `prev` — points to the previous node  
- `next` — points to the next node  

This allows traversal of the list **in both directions**, enabling more flexible insertions, deletions, and lookups.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- What a doubly linked list is  
- How to use doubly linked lists  
- The difference between singly and doubly linked lists  
- How to insert, delete, and traverse nodes in both directions  
- How memory is allocated and freed in linked structures
